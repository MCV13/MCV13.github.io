## <center>The Dark Web!</center>

When most people hear about the dark web they associate it to a place in the internet where illegal activity like the buying and selling of weapons and drugs, finding hitmen for hire, hacking services, and human trafficking among many other services take place. This place called the "dark web" can sound like a pretty scary place to be in and even though some people use it for nefarious things it is all not that bad if you know what you are doing and are not doing illegal activities. The dark web was designed to keep us safe and help protect our identity!

## <center>So, What the Heck is the Dark Web?</center>

Before I get to what the dark web is we have to first understand how the word wide web works. The world wide web has 3 layers but it is essentially a system of public webpages that can be easily accessed through the internet. This vast place is filled with millions of web pages and servers that can be accessed anywhere in the world at any given time. Now, to most of us we are very familiar with this side of the web called the "visible" internet and is where sites like google and amazon can be easily found. This "visible" internet is also known as the surface or open web and is where most of go to use the internet which makes up about 5% of the total internet. 

The second layer of the web is known as the deep web. The deep web is made up of 90% of the total internet and rests below the surface layer. Many people confuse the deep web with the dark web but in general the deep web is a relatively legal and safe part of the web. Some parts of the deep web include databases and intranets like government networks, legal documents, and medical records.

The dark web is the third layer that lays below the deep web and makes up roughly about 5% of the internet. Originally, it was designed to help protect our identity and keep safe from prying eyes. In the dark web the sites that are not indexed can be found here and can only be accessed through special web browsers like the TOR browser.

The dark web can be broken down into three parts:

1. Inaccessible by traditional browsers. Since the browsers needed to access the dark web have unique registry operations it is very difficult to access it through conventional browsers. It is also hidden by various networks and firewalls as well as heavily encrypted. 
2. Virtual traffic tunnels. What this means is that traffic goes through a randomized network infrastructure.
3. No webpage indexing. Search engines like google and yahoo cannot discover or display result pages from within the dark web. 

The dark web has a bad reputation associated with people who use it but there is also good use of its framework. In this day and age where we freely let sites like Facebook, Google, and Amazon track our every move whether it is by selling us products by listening through our phones or by selling and using our own data for their advanatage it has become harder to keep our data secure and one way this can be done is by using the dark web.
