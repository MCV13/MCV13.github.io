Blog 16, on how to deploy our "Hello World" application, left off on how to upload our application to Amazon S3. We provisioned an Amazon S3 bucket prepare the application revision's files for the bucket, bundle the revision's files, and then push the revision to the bucket. This weeks Blog will cover how to deploy our "Hello World" application. We will use the CLI to deploy the revision and monitor the progress. 

To deploy your application revision using the CLI follow the steps below.

1. We first need to have a deployment group and to do that we need a service role ARN. This will give an IAM role that allows a service permission to access your EC2 instance. 
2. Once we have created the ARN, we need to call `create-deployment-group` command to create a deployment groupe named `HelloWorld_DepGroup`, that is associated with the application named `HelloWorld_App`, by using the EC2 instance tag named `CodeDeployDemo` and deployment configuration named `CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime`, with the service role ARN. Run this command `aws deploy create-deployment-group --application-name HelloWorld_App --deployment-group-name HelloWorld_DepGroup --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime --ec2-tag-filters Key=Name,Value=CodeDeployDemo,Type=KEY_AND_VALUE --service-role-arn serviceRoleARN`.
3. Before we create a deployment the instances must have the CodeDeploy agent installed. Run the following command to install the agent `aws ssm create-association --name AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage --targets Key=tag:Name,Values=CodeDeployDemo --parameters action=Install,name=AWSCodeDeployAgent --schedule-expression "cron(0 2 ? * SUN *)" `.
4. Call the `create-deployment` command to create a deployment a deployment associated with the application named `HelloWorld_App`, the deployment configuration named `CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime`, and the deployment group named `HelloWorld_DepGroup`, using the application revision named `HelloWorld_App.zip` in the bucket named `codedeploydemobucket`. Run the following command on the terminal `aws deploy create-deployment --application-name HelloWorld_App --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime --deployment-group-name HelloWorld_DepGroup --s3-location bucket=codedeploydemobucket,bundleType=zip,key=HelloWorld_App.zip`.
5. Lastly to monitor and troubleshoot the deployment using the CLI we need to get the deployment's ID by calling the `list-deployments` command against the application named `HelloWorld_App` and the deployment group named `HelloWorld_Degroup`. Run the command `aws deploy list-deployments --application-name HelloWorld_App --deployment-group-name HelloWorld_DepGroup --query "deployments" --output text`. 
6. To call the `get-deployment` command witht the ID run the following command `aws deploy get-deployment --deployment-id deploymentID --query "deploymentInfo.status" --output text`.
7. These commands will return the deployment's status. If there are no errors and it's successful the value is `Succeeded`. 
8. To verify that the installation is working use the public DNS address of the EC2 instance to view the page in a web browser. If everything comes out with no issue you should see a "Hello World" webpage.
