In Blog 17, on how to deploy our "Hello World" application, left off on how to deploy our application. We used the AWS CLI  to deploy the revision and monitor the deployment's progress. After the application revision is successfully deployed, we checked the results. For this final part on the deployment of our "Hello world" application we will show how to update and redeploy and clean up our application resources.

To update and redploy our webpage we will first need to make a change to our webpage. Follow the steps below:

1. Open up a text editor and change the directory to `cd c:\temp\HelloWorldApp
vi index.html`. 
2. Once you have `index.html` opened up make a change to the file. For our case we will change the title of the webpage to "This again?!", change the background color, and font size. 
```
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
<html>
<head>
  <title>This again?!</title>
  <style>
    body {
      color: #ffffff;
      background-color: #000ecc;
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;  
      font-size:12px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div align="center"><h1>This again?!</h1></div>
  <div align="center"><h2>You have successfully deployed a revision of an application using CodeDeploy</h2></div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```
3. Now that we have changed the `index.html` file we will redploy using the CLI to make sure our change was processed. We need to call the `create-deployment` using the application named `Hello_World_App` the deployment configuration named `CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime`, the deployment group named `HelloWorld_DepGroup`, and the revision named `HelloWorld_App.zip` in the bucket named `codedeploydemobucket`. Run the following command in the terminal ` aws deploy create-deployment --application-name HelloWorld_App --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime --deployment-group-name HelloWorld_DepGroup --s3-location bucket=codedeploydemobucket,bundleType=zip,key=HelloWorld_App.zip`.
4. Restart CodeDeploy and check your website to see if the change went through. If it did you should have this screenshot below. ![logo](https://i.imgur.com/EZLCeGf.png)

Now that we have successfully changed our website and redeployed to check our updated webpage we will clean up the application and related sources. 
We will continnue using the CLI to do this process. 

1. First step is to delete AWS CloudFormation stack by calling the `delete-stack` command against the stack named `CodeDeployDemoStack`. This will end all attached Amazon EC2 instances and delete all IAM roles originally created by the stack. Do this by running the command `aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name CodeDeployDemoStack`.
2. Next we need to delete the S3 bucket by calling the rm command with the `--recursive` switch against the bucket named `codedeploydemobucket`. This will delete the bucket as well as any object that are inside the bucket. Run the command `aws s3 rm s3://codedeploydemobucket --recursive`.
3. Delete the `HelloWorld_App` application from CodeDeploy. We will do this with the `delete-application` command. This deletes all associated deployment group records and deployment records for the application. Run the command `aws deploy delete-application --application-name HelloWorld_App`.
4. We also need to delete the Systems Manager State Manager association. Input the following command to the CLI `aws ssm delete-association --assocation-id association-id`.
5. Last but not least to finish this tutorial, if you did not use the AWS CloudFormation stack for this project we need to delete any instance we manually created. For us to do this we will need to have the ID of the Amazon EC2 instance to terminate. After having the ID run the following command `aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids instanceId`.
