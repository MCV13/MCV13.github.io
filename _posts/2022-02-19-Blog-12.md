Google Cloud, much like AWS, is a service Google provides and consists of physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, and virtual resources like VM's that are contained in Google's data centers. Data centers are located in Asis, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. 

Google provides several services that can help you develop your website or application on Google Cloud. Some of these services include; cloud storage, cloud SQL, cloud CDN, cloud SDK, vertex AI, AI infrastructure, API management, cloud GPU's, and anthos.

User can access these services through Googles UI known as the Google cloud console. The console provides a web-based, graphical UI that you can use to manage your projects. If you prefered to use a CLI you can perform most Google cloud tasks by using the Google Cloud CLI. The gcloud CLI lets you manage development workflow and Google Cloud resources in a terminal window. Lastly you can also use client libraries that enable you to create and manage resources. 

Google Cloud in the past may have been falling behind AWS and Azure but it is slowly catching up. It would be a wise move to learn Google Cloud to open up possibilites of jobs looking for engineers that are familiar with Google Cloud.
