Go is a programming language that was designed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Ken Thompson, and Rob Pike. The language is often reffered to as Golang but many call it "Go" for short. It was designed to help address problems of other languages but to also keep their main characteristics. 

Go is a strong and statically typed language. It inherits features like Java and C++. With strong typying it means that the type of a variable cannot change over time. For example when you declare a variable "a" to hold an integer, it's always going to hold an integer and you can't put a boolean or string in it. Static typying means that all of the variables have to be defined at compile time, although you can bypass this with features that are included in Go. 

## Key Features
1. Simple to use. Go language is used for its simplicity.
2. Fast compile times. Go focuses on keeping compile times down.
3. Garbage collected. This means you don't have to manage your own memory. 
4. Built in concurrency. Go has concurrency primitives built right into the language. What this means that instead of having a library where we have to import, in order to work with concurrency we can just do concurrent development right in the base language. 
5. Compile to standalone libraries. Go compiles down to a standalone library. This allows when you compile your Go application everything will be going to a bundled single library that is related to the Go application.
