Go is a programming language that was designed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Ken Thompson, and Rob Pike. The language is often reffered to as Golang but many call it "Go" for short. It was designed to help address problems of other languages but to also keep their main characteristics. 

Go is a strong and statically typed language. It inherits features like Java and C++. With strong typying it means that the type of a variable cannot change over time. For example when you declare a variable "a" to hold an integer, it's always going to hold an integer and you can't put a boolean or string in it. Static typying means that all of the variables have to be defined at compile time, although you can bypass this with features that are included in Go. 

## Key Features
1. Simple to use. Go language is used for its simplicity.
2. Fast compile times. Go focuses on keeping compile times down.
3. Garbage collected. This means you don't have to manage your own memory. 
4. Built in concurrency. Go has concurrency primitives built right into the language. What this means that instead of having a library where we have to import, in order to work with concurrency we can just do concurrent development right in the base language. 
5. Compile to standalone libraries. Go compiles down to a standalone library. This allows when you compile your Go application everything will be going to a bundled single library that is related to the Go application.

## <center>So, should you learn Go?!</center>

In my opinion, learning Go wouldn't hurt especially if you are a beginner and haven't coded in other languages. Object-oriented languages like Java, C, C++, and Ruby are sometimes a bit difficult to learn for beginners and Go is a nice alternative to learn as it is beginner friendly. Here are some reasons to think about wanting to learn Go:

1. Beginner friendly
2. Great for those who deal with web design, shell, and automation.
3. Higly recommended for CLI tool development.
4. Popular among big companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Intel, and IBM.
5. According to [ZiprRecruiter.com](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Golang-Developer-Salary), "as of Oct 1, 2021, the average annual pay for a Golang Developer in the United States is $128,736 a year."

If any of these apply to you then I would recommend learning Golang. To prove how simple it I will show below how to run a simple "Hello World!" program.

## <center>How to write a simple "Hellow World!" program in Go.</center>

 ```go
1 package main
2
3 import "fmt"
4
5 func main(){
6     fmt.Println("Hello World!")
7 }
```
Above you can see our simple "Hello World!" program and I will be explaining what each line of code does. 
- Line 1, `package main` defines your package as main.
- Line 3, `import "fmt"` the 'fmt" is short for format. This package includes all functions like printing and interpolating strings.
- Line 5, `func main(){` is our main function for our program. The open bracket starts the beginning of our function.
- Line 6, `fmt.Println("Hello World!")` this goes into the import fmt library and uses Println to print and output our string "Hello Word!" to the user.
- Line 7, `}` is the close bracket which ends our function main.

### There it is a simple "Hello World!" program written in Go!
