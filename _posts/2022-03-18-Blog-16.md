## <center>How to Deploy a "Hellow World" Application with CodeDeploy (Windows Server), Pt3.</center>

We left off from last week's, Blog 15, on how to deploy our application on CodeDeploy Windows Server. We configured our source content to deploy to the Windows Server EC2 instance by creating a web page, creating a script to run the application, and by adding an application specification file. Now in order to upload our "Hello World" application to S3 we must provision an Amazon S3 bucket. If we follow the steps below we will be able to upload our application to S3. 

Creating an S3 Bucket
1. If you are using the CLI call the mb command to create an Amazon S3 bucket and name it `codedeploydemobucket:`. The command to do this on CLI is `aws s3 mb s3://codedeploydemobucket`. You can also create an S3 bucket on the console by selecting the s3 console and choose to create bucket. 
2. Next we need to give permissions to the S3 bucket and your IAM user. Copy and paste the code below to create an S3 bucket policy that will allow an account to upload files to any directory in S3 bucket named `codedeploydemobucket`.
```go   
   {
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::codedeploydemobucket/*",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "111122223333"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
3. Next to verify the S3 bucket will allow download requests from an EC2 instance you will need to create a S3 bucket policy. Copy and paste the code below.
```go 
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::codedeploydemobucket/*",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:role/CodeDeployDemo"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
 4. In order to have our account must have permissions to upload the revision to the S3 bucket. A way to this is to specify this through an IAM policy. Copy and paste the code below to allow an IAM user to upload revisions anywhere in the S3 bucket named `codedeploydemobucket`
```go 
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",  
  "Statement":[
    {
      "Effect":"Allow",
      "Action":["s3:PutObject"],
      "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::codedeploydemobucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
 5. The next step is to prepare the applications files for the bucket. The web page, AppSec file, and the script must be organized on our machine `c:\
 |--temp``\
    |--HelloWorldApp\
        |-- appsec.yml
        |-- before-install.bat
        |-- index.html`
 6. Next we need to bundle the application's files into a single archive file and push the archive file. On the development machine switch to the folder where the files are saved. `cd c:\temp\HelloWorldApp`
 7. Run the following code to create-application command to register a new application namded HelloWorld_App with CodeDeploy. `aws deploy create-application --application-name HelloWorld_App`. 
 8. Lastly run the following code to have CodeDeploy call the push command to bundle the files together, upload the revision on S3, and register the information with CodeDeploy about the uploaded revision all at once. `aws deploy push --application-name HelloWorld_App --s3-location s3://codedeploydemobucket/HelloWorld_App.zip --ignore-hidden-files`. What this command does it essentially bundles all the files from the current directory into a single zip file named `HelloWorld_App.zip`, uploads the revision to the `codedeploydemobucket`, and registers information with CodeDeploy about the uploaded revision. 

The next thing to do is to deploy our Hello World application, which will be covered for next week's blog.
