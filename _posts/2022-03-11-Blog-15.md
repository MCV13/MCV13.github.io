Last weeks blog we went over what AWS CodeDeplpy does as a service on the Amazon Console. I explained the first step in running our application was to first launch a Windows Server Amazon EC2 instance in order to run our "Hello World" application. The next step is to configure our source content to deploy to the Windows Server Amazon EC2 instance. If we follow these steps we will be able to deploy a single web page to the EC2 instance running Windows Server, which will run Internet Information Services as its web server. 

Creating a Web Page
1. Create a subdirectory named `HelloWorldApp` in your `c:\temp` folder, and then cd into that folder.
2. Open up a text editor to create a file inside of the folder and name it `index.html`. You can use any text editor you have installed on your terminal like vim or nano. 
3. Copy and paste the following HTML code to the file and then save it. a
   
```go
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
<head>
  <title>Hello, World!</title>
  <style>
    body {
      color: #ffffff;
      background-color: #0188cc;
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;  
      font-size:14px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div align="center"><h1>Hello, World!</h1></div>
  <div align="center"><h2>You have successfully deployed an application using CodeDeploy</h2></div>
  <div align="center">
    <p>What to do next? Take a look through the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy">CodeDeploy Documentation</a>.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```
Next we will create a script to run the application that CodeDeploy will use to set up the web server on the EC2 instance. 
1. `cd` into the folder where `index.html` is saved and open a text editor to create a new file which will be named `before-install.bat`. 
2. Copy and paste the following script code to the file and save it. 

    `REM Install Internet Information Server (IIS).
    c:\Windows\Sysnative\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -Command Import-Module -Name ServerManager
    c:\Windows\Sysnative\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -Command Install-WindowsFeature Web-Server`

The next step is to add an application specification file (AppSpec file) in addition to the web page and batch script file. AppSpec is a YAML formatted file that is used by CodeDeploy. We need to create an AppSpec file and name it `appspec.yml` which needs to be placed in the application source code root folder. 
1. Go to the folder where `index.html` and `before-install.bat` files are saved and open a text editor and create a new file called `appspec.yml`. 
2. Copy and paste the following YAML code to the file and save it. 
```yaml
   version: 0.0
os: windows
files:
  - source: \index.html
    destination: c:\inetpub\wwwroot
hooks:
  BeforeInstall:
    - location: \before-install.bat
      timeout: 900
```
CodeDeploy will use the AppSpec file to copy `index.html` file in the application source code root folder ot the `c:  \inetpub\wwwroot` folder on the EC2 instance. While it's being deployed, it will run the `before-install.bat` script file on the EC2 instance during the deployment lifecycle event. 

After doing the above steps we will next upload our "Hello World" application to S3 bucket. I will be covering this part in next weeks blog.
