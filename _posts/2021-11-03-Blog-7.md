Last week's blog we went over how to install the TOR browswer so that we can access and host our website on the dark web. For this final part, of the 3 part series, I will finally explain how to get your Rasbperry Pi set up to host your website on the dark web.

This tutorial will be a quick installation and will get your host site up and running on the dark web using a Raspberry Pi. Follow the steps below in order to host your website. 

1. Plug in your SD card into your card reader (USB adapter) and plug it into your computer.
2. Access the Raspberry Pi imager and when prompted for what OS to choose from pick Rasbperry Pi 0S (32-bit). From the SD card drop menu pick the SD card name you plugged into the card reader. After you have selected the OS and SD card, click on write.

3. After you have installed the basic getting started instructions make sure to you are connected to wireless or ethernet internect connection. 
4. In network preferences you can set up a static I.P. address but it is not required. You can do this by right clicking on the top right hand corner WIFI symbol. I set a static I.P. address.

5. We want to be able to access our Raspberry Pi remotely over SSH so we need to make some changes to our preferences. To do this click the raspberry logo on the top left hand corner and go to preferences and select Raspberry Pi Configuration.

6. Select the Interfaces tab and enable SSH, then click ok.

7. Lastly, before we SSH we need to shutdown our Raspberry Pi. Once this is done we will boot it again.
8. Open up a command propmt so that we can SSH to our Raspberry PI. Make sure to have your static I.P. address we set up in the previous steps. Note the address may be different than the one I am using if you used a different address make sure to change it to your address. Run the following command `ssh pi@10.7.1.79`. Type yes and input your password you set up.
9. Run the following command to `sudo apt update` to update our repositories on our pi. 
10. Next we need to install the TOR browser. Run the following command `sudo apt install tor` click y for yes. 
11. We need to configure TOR in order for everything to get our website up and running on the dark web. To do this run the command `sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc`.
12. We need to uncomment two lines by reomving the # from the two lines of code. Below you will find which ones to remove.

By removing the # on the firt line of code what this allows is to store your onion address. The second line of code lets the TOR network know your access point. 
13. Run `sudo service tor stop` and then `sudo service tor start` to restart TOR. 
14. Run `sudo service tor statu` to make sure TOR is actively running. If you get this below you are running TOR.

15. Now that we are running TOR, we need to find our onion address. Run this command to find out our address `sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/hostname`

You now know your onion adress aka dark website!
16. To be able to host and access your site you need to install nginx. Run `sudo apt install nginx`. Hit y for yes.
17. Run `sudo service nginx start` to start nginx.
18. Run `sudo service nginx status` to check that nginx is up and running. 
19. Installing nginx is will allow us to access our onion address on the TOR browser. To do this get your onion address and paste the url on the TOR broswer. If you did this right you should get the following default page.

20. To change the defualt page we need to change a few things to the nginx.conf file. Run `sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. 
21. To make our website safer we need to uncomment the two following lines by removing #.

22. Under the first line of code we uncommented, we need to add a line of code. Type in `port_in_redirect off;`. Type `ctrl x` and save the file. 
23. Run `sudo service nginx restart` to restart nginx. 
24. We can now customize our website. To do this we need to change our directory, run `cd /var/ww`.
24. Run `ls`. You should now be able to see the html file. 
25. Run `cd html` and you should be able to see the `index.nginx-debian.html` file. 
26. We will now remove the `index.nginx-debian.html` file, run `sudo rm index.nginx-debian.html`. 
27. Lastly to customize our webpage run `sudo nano index.html` this will open up nano and you can code your html website! 

Once you code your html website you can refresh the tor browser and will see your onion website up and running!
