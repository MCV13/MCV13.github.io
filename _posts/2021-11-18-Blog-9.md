Terraform is an open source infrastructure software tool that was created by HashiCorp. It is known as an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can be used to automate and create infrastructure on AWS easily and in an effective way. Below I will be explaning on how to set up terraform on Ubuntu and creating an EC2 instance on AWS.

## <center>Step by Step Instructions to Set up Terraform on Ubuntu and creating an EC2 Instance on AWS</center>

Before we start we need to make sure we have an account set up on AWS. Once you have that set up make sure to log in to your AWS account and proceed to the following steps. 

1. Open up your terminal and run `terraform --version` this will output a text if we have terraform installed. 
2. Create a working directory for your terraform files. 
3. Install the unzip package. If you don't have it run `sudo apt-get install unzip -y`.
4. Run `wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.0.11/terraform_1.0.11_linux_amd64.zip -O terraform.zip`.
5. Run `unzip terraform.zip`.
6. Run `sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin`.
7. Run `terraform.zip`
8. Run `terraform -v` to check that terraform is installed. 
9. Before we go on we need to install AWS CLI on our Ubuntu Terminal so we can connect our AWS account to be able to use terraform. 
10. Run `curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"`.
11. Run `unzip awscliv2.zip`.
12. Run `sudo ./aws/install`.
13. Run `aws --v` to check if we have aws installed. 
14. We now need to go into our AWS account dashboard. Go to security credentials circled in the image below.

15. create a new access key. Make sure to save the access key and secret key for the next step.

16. On your terminal run `aws configure`. You will be prompted for your AWS access key ID as well as your secret access key. 
17. Next you will be prompted with Default region name. For this field you would input the region your in for your AWS account. For example [us-west-2].
18. Finally you will be prompted with the Default output format. You can hit enter and continue. 
19. Now that we have all the pre-requisites we can continue on to making our .tf file which will contain our automated code to create an EC2 instance on AWS. 
20. Create a new file, for this example we will name the file `myec2instance.tf`.
21. Inside the file input the following code and save it once completed.

```json
#Looks for AWS folder and pulls credentials
provider "aws"{
    profile = "default"
    region = "us-west-2"
}
# Creates EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "testing"{
     
    ami = "ami-013a129d325529d4d"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"

    tags = {
        Name = "myfirstec2instance"
    }
}
```
22. In our terminal run `terraform init`. This command will prepare your working directory for other commands. 
23. Run `terraform validate`. This will check if the config file is valid. 
24. Run `terraform plan` to show changes require by the current configuration. 
25. Run `terraform apply` this will create or update the infrastructure in our case the EC2 instance. You will receive an output showing you its creating the instance if successful you can go back to your AWS dashboard and check the EC2 instance tab to see your instance running.
26. Lastly if you would like to delete the instance run `terraform destroy`. This will destroy the previous infrastructure.
