## <center>What is a LAMP Stack?</center>

If you ever wanted to host a website which delivers high-performance web applications and had no idea on how to start one then you probably have heard from others in the IT world that you should look into installing a LAMP stack. That is great and all but what does that even mean? 

Well, a LAMP stack is one of the most well and common known software stacks out there and is an acronym denoting popular web applications which include Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP). A LAMP stack delivers the first layer which is the Linux OS and sets up the foundation for the stack model. The second layer is made up of the web server software, Apache Web Server and sits on top of the Linux layer. MySQL is the third layer and is where all databases are set up and sit on top of the Apache layer. Finally we have the fourth layer, PHP, which sits on top of all the layers, and it can consists of a scripting layer or other programming languages. In the PHP layer is where the website and it's web applications run. All of these layers are needed to host a website and I will be explaining how to set up a LAMP stack on your terminal.

## <center>Installing LAMP Stack on Ubuntu 18.04</center>

Before we start we need to have the recommended system requirtements:

1. Have Ubuntu 18.04 installed. This will be the first layer on our stack. 
2. Ubuntu server with sudo privileges. 
3. A terminal or CLI.
4. Have the apt-get tool, pre-loaded in Ubuntu 18.04.

Once we have the system requirements proceed opening up a terminal and follow the steps to install a LAMP stack.

1. Open a terimnal and run the command <b>*sudo apt-get update*</b>. This will ensure that we have the latest installations. 
2. To install the second layer, Apache Web Server, run the following command <b>*sudo apt-get install apache2*</b>. When prompted and asked to continue press yes.
3. Run the follwing command to make sure everything is installed correctly by running the Apache service status, <b>*sudo service apache2 status*</b>. If everything is installed correctly you should be prompted with an output saying active

In most cases if you aren't prompted with the following output what it means is Apache was not automatically started when you followed step 2. To fix this we will have to run the command <b>*sudo service apache2 start*</b> and we should have Apache running.
4. Run the command <b>*ifconfig*</b> to find out your IP address.

   Open a web browser and in the address bar go to your localhost and type in your IP adress, you should get the following Apache Web Server page displayed below:

5. The third layer in our LAMP stack is MySQL. Run the follwing command <b>*sudo apt-get install mysql-server*</b>. When prompted say yes to complete the installation. Due note that during the installation you will be asked to set the root user password.
6. Run the following command <b>*mysql -u root -p*</b>. This command will ask you for your root password and once you put the password in you will have access to mysql.

7. We will now create a simple database. In my sql type <b>*create database testdb*</b> and hit enter. After pressing enter type in <b>*;*</b> and hit enter. To see our database we just created type in <b>*show databases*</b> hit enter then type <b>*;*</b> and hit enter. You will have a display of all the databases and should see the testdb we have just created. Type <b>*quit*</b> to get out of mysql.

8. We now want to install phpmyadmin. Run the following commmand <b>*sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin*</b> and type yes when prompted. You will then be asked which server to configure phpmyadmin and select apache2. You will be prompted with another package configuration and select yes. Provide a new password for phpmyadmin.
9. Open your web browser and type in your IP address from above followed by /phpmyadmin. You will get the following 404 error page.

To fix this we need to edit the php.ini file. Locate your php.ini file, you can do this my running the command <b>*sudo nano /etc/php/7.2/apache2/php.ini*</b>, if you don't find file you might need to check the version of php and replace it with the correct one on the path. Scroll down on the file in order to uncomment an extension. We want to delete the <b>*;*</b>, press <b>*ctrl+x*</b> type yes to save and hit enter. <b>*Due note that this step will not work as you have not installed php yet and don't have the directories/files associated with it. This is only to be able to access the database on the phpadmin database webpage. You can skip steps 9-12 if you don't want to set up phpadmin webpage and would like to install php first. After installing php you can continue steps 9-12* </b>

10. Next we want to add a line to the apache2.conf file. Run the command  <b>*sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf*</b>. Scroll all the way down and type into the file the following <b>*Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf*</b>

    type <b>*ctrl+x*</b> type y to save and hit enter.
11. Run the command <b>*sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart*</b> to restart apache and open up your browser and you should get the following

13. Finally we are ready to set up the fourth layer, the PHP layer. To do this run the commmand, <b>*sudo apt-get install php*</b>. 
14. Next we will make a simple php file that will display hello world to check if our wepage is running. Run the command, <b>*sudo nano /var/www/html/test.php*</b>, test.php will be the name that we give the file. Type in the following line <b>*<?php echo 'Hello World';?* </b> Enter <b>*ctrl+x*</b> enter y to save and hit enter.
