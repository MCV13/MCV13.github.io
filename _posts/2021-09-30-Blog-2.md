## <center>What is a LAMP Stack?</center>

If you ever wanted to host a website which delivers high-performance web applications and had no idea on how to start one then you probably have heard from others in the IT world that you should look into installing a LAMP stack. That is great and all but what does that even mean? 

Well, a LAMP stack is one of the most well and common known software stacks out there and is an acronym denoting popular web applications which include Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP). A LAMP stack delivers the first layer which is the Linux OS and sets up the foundation for the stack model. The second layer is made up of the web server software, Apache Web Server and sits on top of the Linux layer. MySQL is the third layer and is where all databases are set up and sit on top of the Apache layer. Finally we have the fourth layer, PHP, which sits on top of all the layers, and it can consists of a scripting layer or other programming languages. In the PHP layer is where the website and it's web applications run. All of these layers are needed to host a website and I will be explaining how to set up a LAMP stack on your terminal.

Before we start we need to have the recommended system requirtements:

1. Have Ubuntu 18.04 installed. This will be the first layer on our stack. 
2. Ubuntu server with sudo privileges. 
3. A terminal or CLI.
4. Have the apt-get tool, pre-loaded in Ubuntu 18.04.

Once we have the system requirements proceed opening up a terminal and follow the steps to install a LAMP stack.

1. Open a terimnal and run the command <b>*sudo apt-get update*</b>. This will ensure that we have the latest installations. 
2. To install the second layer, Apache Web Server, run the following command <b>*sudo apt-get install apache2*</b>. When prompted and asked to continue press yes.
3. Run the follwing command to make sure everything is installed correctly by running the Apache service status, <b>*sudo service apache2 status*</b>. If everything is installed correctly you should be prompted with an output saying active

In most cases if you aren't prompted with the following output what it means is Apache was not automatically started when you followed step 2. To fix this we will have to run the command <b>*sudo service apache2 start*</b> and we should have Apache running.
4. Run the command <b>*ifconfig*</b> to find out your IP address.

   Open a web browser and in the address bar go to your localhost and type in your IP adress, you should get the following Apache Web Server page displayed below:

5. The third layer in our LAMP stack is MySQL. Run the follwing command <b>*sudo apt-get install mysql-server*</b>. When prompted say yes to complete the installation. Due note that during the installation you will be asked to set the root user password.
6. Run the following command <b>*mysql -u root -p*</b>. This command will ask you for your root password and once you put the password in you will have access to mysql.

7. We will now create a simple database. In my sql type <b>* create database testdb*</b> and hit enter. After pressing enter type in <b>*;*</b> and hit enter. To see our database we just created type in <b>*show databases*</b> hit enter then type <b>*;*</b> and hit enter. You will have a display of all the databases and should see the testdb we have just created. Type <b>*quit*</b> to get out of mysql.

8. We now want to install phpmyadmin. Run the following commmand <b>*sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin*</b> and type yes when prompted. You will then be asked which server to configure phpmyadmin and select apache2. You will be prompted with another package configuration and select yes. Provide a new password for phpmyadmin.
