Just like AWS has a service called an EC2 (elastic compute cloud) Google Cloud has it's own version called Google compute engine (GCE). GCE is the infrstructure as a service component of Google Cloud Platform which is build on the global infrastructure that runs Google's search enginge, Gmail, Youtube and other services. Essentially GCE enables users to launch virtual machines on demand. 

Google allows new customers to receive $300 in free credits to spend on Google Cloud. Google also gives a general purpose machine (e2-micro instance) per month for free and is not charged against your credits. So if you are intersted in getting a first hand feel on Google's Cloud Platform I highly suggest getting experience with it. 

In the steps below I will go over how to create a simple general purpose E2 instance that is relatively low cost.

1. Log into Google Cloud Console.
2. Click hamburger > Compute Engine > VM instances. 
3. When you create your first instance for the first time, Google will prompt you to create a project, simply name your project name and select billing account and click on the 'Create Button'.
4. Your project name will appear in the top of the screen. Click on the 'Create' button of the 'Compute Engine-VM Intances' pop window, and 'Create an instance' will pop up.
5. Next name your instance.
6. Select the region and zone.
7. Select the required machine type based on your requirement databases demand memory-optimized VMs.
8. Select the 'Boot Disk' by selecting the required operating system. If we are creating a 'Windows Server' click on the 'Change Button'. 
9. From the 'Boot Disk' pop-up window, select the 'Operating System' as 'Windows Server' and 'Version' as 'Windows Server 2019 Datacenter Core' and click on the 'Select' button. 
10. Next select if you need an API access and firewall exceptions. All of these are optional choices. If you want you can give access to your VM to specific groups.
11. Finally click on 'Create' button. This is the last step in deploying your instance.
