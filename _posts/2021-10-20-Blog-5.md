In last weeks, Blog 4, I explained what the dark web was and that it was created in order to protect user data from unwanted tracking. In this weeks blog I will explain how you can host a simple website on the dark web using the TOR browser. <span style="color:red"> <b>*Full disclosure, anything explained here is for educational purposes and in now way will it be used for malicious intention. The goal is to host a simple website on part of the web most are not used to. In no way will this be used to search for websites that are illegal. Please never use your local machine to access the dark web without the proper safety measures needed so that you don't get hacked.*

There are several ways to access the dark web. The easiest way is to simply download and install the TOR Browser and start browsing the dark web. If you do this without taking security measures you are prone to being hacked. In order to prevent any hacking to our local machine we will be using a cheap inexpensive way so that if something happens we don't mind if something gets hacked as it will not affect our local machine and that is through the use of a Raspberry pi.

A Raspberry pi is a type of computer that is relatively small in size and inexpensive way to do simple things like surf the web, watch videos, use word processing, and even be able to play video games. It was developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation alongside Broadcom. It is essentially a small pocket computer that you can take anywhere and just plug in a monitor, mouse, and keyboard to do pretty much anything a desktop would do.
