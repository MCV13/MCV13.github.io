Kubernetes is an open-source container management and cluster tool. It allows for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. Originally, it was designed at Google but itâ€™s now managed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes works with several container runtimes like Docker, Containerd, and CRI-O. In this tuturial we will be deploying Kubernetes on AWS.

We first need to create a kubernetes cluster on AWS. Kubernetes works best when you have multiple computers so we will be creating 3 servers on AWS. Having multiple servers runnig allows us to have different servers to run in case one goes down. Now AWS has a service called EKS where it creates a cluster for you which is easier to manage and quick to start but for this instance we want to manage our own servers from scratch to see what's going behind the scenes. 

What we will to deplpy kubernetes is have AWS console up and running and docker documentation since kubernetes works best with docker we will be using docker for our servers. 

Creating servers on AWS:

1. Step one is to create an EC2 instance on your AWS console. Launch an instance and choose an AMI for this we will be using Ubuntu 18.04. The instance type will be a t3.micro and for our configuration settings we want to create 3 instances. For the security group select the default VPC security group. Lastly create a new key pair and name it k8s-servers and download the key pair. Feel free to name your instances any name you want once they are running.

2. We need to change the security group to enable SSH. Go to the security group. Add an inbound rule that allows SSH from anywhere in the world.

3. Now that we have created our instances and changed the security group we will continue with SSH into our servers. 

SSH into our servers on the CLI:
1. Open up 3 terminals since we will be SSH'ing to 3 different servers. 
2. Change the directory to where you downloaded your key pair and chmod 400 your file. Only do this to the first terminal which will be our "Master" instance. 
3. Now we can SSH into the "Master" server by running the following command `ssh -i k8s-servers.pm ubuntu@3.88.210.29`. You can find the public IPV4 address on the AWS console for your "Master" server.

We will conclude here and continue our final steps to deploy kubernetes on AWS for next weeks blog.
