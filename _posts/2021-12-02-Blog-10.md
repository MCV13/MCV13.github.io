## <center>What is Kubernetes?</center>

Kubernetes is an open-source container management and cluster tool. It allows for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management. Originally, it was designed at Google but it's now managed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes works with several container runtimes like Docker, Containerd, and CRI-O.

If you are using Docker to containerize and run your applications and want everything to run smoothly without having any downtime running your servers then you should really learn Kubernetes! Kubernetes allows us to have a system set in place if for whatever reason a container goes down it can automatically start up a new container. 

Some of the key features Kubernetes provides are the following: 

1. Service discovery and load balancing 
- Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or through their own IP address. If a container has a lot of traffic, Kubernetes is able to load balance and redirect network traffic so the server can continue running. 
2. Storage orchestration
- Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage systemS like cloud providers and local storages.
3. Automated rollouts and rollbacks
- Kubernetes can automate and create new containers for your deployment and remove existing containers and adopt all their resources to the new container. 
4. Automatic bin packing 
- With Kubernetes you can provide it with a cluster of nodes that it can use to run containerized tasks. You can also allow how much CPU and RAM each container needs. 
5. Self-healing
- This means Kubernetes restarts containers that fail and replace it with new containers. It also kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve. 
6. Secret and configuration management 
 - Kubernetes allows you to store and manage information like passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. This lets you deploy and update secrets and application configuratoin without rebuilding your container images without exposing secrets.

In short if you are a developer Kubernetes allows you to learn a new skill that can impact the performance of your applications. You don't have to be an expert in Kubernetes but any skill in automation deployment production can help you land a job in I.T.
