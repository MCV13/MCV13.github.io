## What is Docker?

Docker is a a type of OS software that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. These containers can be used seprately from other containers and can bundle different type of software, libraries, and cofiguration files. Essentially docker is a type of virtual machine that takes less memory space than a software program like virtual box. The difference between the two is that docker uses container based applications and the containers are just user space of the OS whereas a virtual machine is made up of user space and a kernel space of an OS.

## System Requirements Before Installing Docker

Before installing docker make sure you have the following system requirements in order to be able to run docker on Windows using the WSL 2 backend.

1. Windows 10 64-bit: Home or Pro 2004 or higher, or Enterprise or Education 1909 (build 18363 or higher).
2. Enable the WSL 2 feature on Windows.
3. 64-bit processor with SLAT
4. 4GB RAM
5. BIOS-level hardware virtualization which must be enabled in the BIOS settings. 

All requirements can be found on the [docker website](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/).

## Installing Docker on WSL (Ubuntu 18.04)

Once you have all the necessary system requirements you can download the [Docker for Desktop](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe).

1. Install the Docker Desktop Installer.exe
2. When you are asked from the prompt make sure to enable Hyper-V Windows Features or the Install required Windows components for WSL 2 option is selected on the configuration page, otherwise docker will not be able to run.
3. After installation is completed close the application.
4. Open or Start the application Decker Desktop and make sure you give it a few minutes to start. 
5. If you can see the whale icon pop up on the bottom right of your screen where you can see what apps are currently running then it means docker is running.

## Installed Docker, Now what?!

After installing docker we want to create our first image and container. Open up your WSL Ubuntu 18.04 terminal and follow the steps to create an image and container.

1. Before we start run <b>*docker -v*</b> to make sure we have docker on WSL. This command will check the version of docker.
2. Run the command <b>*docker ps*</b>. This will show any containers that are running. Since we just installed Docker this should result in an empty output.
3. If we want to use a specific distrobution OS we need to pull the image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). Find the image you want to use and run the command <b>*docker pull (image name)*</b>. For our example we would need to run the command <b>*docker pull Ubuntu:18.04*</b>. 
4. Run the command <b>*docker images*</b> to make sure you can see Ubuntu 18.04 was successfully pulled. You will know it was pulled if you can see the Ubuntu repository, tag (18.04), and the image ID.
5. We know create a container which will run Ubuntu 18.04. Run the command <b>*docker run --name "enter a container name of your choice" ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash</b>
6. Open a second terminal and run the command <b>*docker ps*</b> and it now should show you a runnning container that you specifically gave a name to. 
7. Now you can go back to the first terminal and use the container which now has Ubuntu 18.04. 
8. After finishing using docker run the command <b>*docker stop "container name"*</b> to exit out and stop running the container.
