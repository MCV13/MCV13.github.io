Last week's blog we went over some of the requirements needed to host a website on the dark web. For our purposes we chose to do it using a Raspberry Pi but the last thing we need to have access to the dark web and be able to access our site is the TOR Browser.

## <center>What is a TOR Browser?</center>

Almost everyone is familiar with what a broswer does and we use it in our every day lives to help us connect to the web. Many of us are familiar with the most common broswers like; Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, Vivaldi, and Duckduckgo but some may not be familiar or are intimidated with the TOR browser. 

TOR broswer, is short for, The Onion Router. It essentially is an application like any other well known broswer that connects us over the internet but it does things a bit different. It allows for anonymous web surfing and protects against traffic analysis. It was designed by the U.S. Navy and is now a free open source platform anyone can freely use. TOR can be used to protect your own privacy without it being monitored.

## <center>So, How Does TOR Work?</center>

The TOR broswer uses a P2P (peer-to-peer) network by using a technology known as onion routing which allows users to browse the internet anonymously. Just like an onion, which has many layers, the onion routing uses multiple layers of encryption to hide both source and destination data over the network. This makes it difficult to monitor or censor online activity. 

The broswer uses TOR servers to send information to an exit node, which is when data leaves the network. When this data has been sent, it's encrypted many times over before being sent to the next node. It repeats the same process several times which in turn makes it difficult to track data to the original source. TOR is an attractive browser to use if you are worried about your privacy but just like any other browser it isn't impervious to attacks.
