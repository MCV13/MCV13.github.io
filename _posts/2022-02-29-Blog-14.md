Amazon Web Services provides a fully managed deployment service that essentially automates software deployments to numerous computing services like EC2, Fargate, and Lambda. CodeDeploy makes it easy to rapidly release new features, avoids downtime during application deployment, and handles the problems that can come with updating your applications. Some of the things you can deploy include code, Lambda functions, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, and multimedia files. CodeDeploy can deploy any application content that runs on server and is stored in S3 buckets, GitHub repo's, or Bitbucket repo's. AWS CodeDeploy benefits from minimized downtime, centralized control, automated deployments, and easy adoption.

1. Make sure you install or upgrade and configure the AWS CLI
2. Create a service role for CodeDeploy
3. Provision an IAM user
4. Create an IAM instance profile for your EC2 instance

Once you have the above steps completed you can now Conncet to your EC2 instnace and follow the steps below. 

1. Sign in to the AWS console and open the EC2 console.
2. Under instances choose **Instances**. 
3. Browse and choose a Windows Server instance from the list and choose **Connect**. 
4. Choose **Get Password** and then **Choose File**. 
5. Browse to and choose the EC2 instance key pair file associated with the Windows Server EC2 instanc and then choose **Open**. 
6. Choose **Decrypt Password**. Make sure to save the password displayed as you will need it for later. 
7. Choose **Download Remote Desktop File**, and then open the file. 
8. You may be prompted to connect even though the publisher of the remote connection can not be identified, so just proceed ot the next step. 
9. Type the password from step 6 and then proceed. 
10. ou may be prompted to connect even though the publisher of the remote connection can not be identified, so just proceed ot the next step.
11. Once you've connected, the desktop of the EC2 instance running Windows Server is displayed. 
12. Disconnect from the EC2 instance. 

Add an inbound rule that allows HTTP traffic to your Windows Server EC2 instance. 

1. Go to EC2 console and choose **Instances** and select your instance. 
2. On the **Description** tab under **Security Groups** choose **view inbound rules**. A list of rules will be displayed. 
3. Under **Security Groups** choose the security group for your EC2 instance. The name may be under *launch-wizard-N*. Choose the **Inbound** tab. If the instance was configured correctly you should see a rule with the following values:
  - Type: HTTP
  - Protocol: TCP
  - Port Range: 80
  - Source: 0.0.0.0/0
4. If these rules don't have the same values you will need to add them into a new security rule.
